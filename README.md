- [Overview](#overview)

For this project, we have to build a webpage in which there is just  a main container containing 3 equal parts.

  - [The challenge](#the-challenge)

This challenge is about building a main container of 3 parts of the same size.
There are a desktop version of the webpage and also a mobile version which has to be
designed in a very different way.

For this project, I have decided to implement a main grid container of 3 columns and 2 rows. 
I have decided to design the webpage this way because I have noticed that in the previous grid-container 
that I have implemented earlier which has only 1 row, the "Leave Me" buttons were 
displaced when checking how this webpage would be displayed on various devices. 
Before that, I used "flex" as the display's property of the main container and the outcome was nice but 
how the buttons were displayed was not satisfying.

Another thing I have noticed is that when the value of "min-height:100vh" the main container was getting
longer and longer as long as I reduce the size of screen therefore I had to set the width of 54rem and an height of 32rem.
I have also set a line height of 1.6rem in order for my webpage to look much to the model design in question.
For the mobile version, my main grid-container has just one column and six rows. Its height is of 69rem and width:21rem.

With this project, I wanted to know more how to set the value of min-heigth to 100vh and where to set it. Do we have to do it
in the body's , the main container's class or any container we want to.
