For this project, I have decided to implement a main grid container with 3 columns and 2 rows. 
I have decided to design this way because I have noticed that in the previous grid-container 
that I have done earlier which has only 1 row, the "Leave Me" buttons were 
displaced when checking how this webpage would be displayed on various devices. 
Before , I used for the display's property of the main container the value "flex"  and the outcome was nice but 
how the buttons were displayed was not satisfying.
